So this is an application to generate html pages in a specific style. You want a different style? Go open the src folder and do as you like! See the sample file for a look at my stylistic choices. Love them, hate them, one person can maintain them. They can be hosted on github. The whole point is to be able to develop webpages without one of those website generators. 


Click the thing called "start" answer some questions, and python will take a generic file, make some text replacements, and output a webpage for you. You can use the Images folder for a logo or for an image gallery.

Top of the page has a logo, title, and two cols: One for describing the project in a paragraph or two, and the other for a list of features and links. The image gallery goes under that. Simple!
